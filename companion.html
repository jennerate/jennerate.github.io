                <p class="description">This project was done during a 6-week course at Emily Carr. I was given the topic “Sauder”, the commerce faculty at the University of British Columbia (UBC), as a jumping off point to create a mobile application.</p>
                <p class="title">Roles & Responsibilities</p>
                <p class="description">While there were a few deliverables, this project was almost entirely self directed. I was responsible for research, paper prototyping, usability testing, low and high fidelity mock ups, and visual design.</p>

                <p class="title">Diverging & Converging</p>
                <p class="description">To explore my given topic, I began by brainstorming UBC related issues for 10 minutes. There were a few areas I wanted to explore and I wanted to keep track of my ideas without worrying too much about how they would visually appear on paper (which I have learned, slows me down). Sticky notes are fantastic for this reason.</p>
                <p class="description">Working under a time constraint is always anxiety inducing — so much so that it can paralyze thought. But by giving myself a fixed amount of time to diverge my thoughts, I was able to recall most significant issues and exclude ones that were less important. By using affinity mapping, I grouped similar issues together. This was incredibly useful for finding connections in and between groups. For example, I realized that long wait times are not exclusive to UBC’s counselling office, but in other universities as well. This served as a jumping off point for forming assumptions about pain points that I could later validate or reject by talking to users.</p>

                <p class="description">One year ago, I didn’t know there were issues with UBC Counselling until I saw <a href="https://www.ubyssey.ca/news/the-story-behind-the-two-week-ubc-counselling-wait/" class="hovering-a">this</a> article and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/57bm7v/so_i_visited_ubc_counselling/" class="hovering-a">this</a> Reddit post detailing JangsJudgement’s experience. To put things into perspective, the article states:</p>
                <p class="description-quote">"When a student experiences these longer wait times — the wait isn’t consistently several weeks long — they are a result of a massive increase in demand for the counselling service. According to statistics from UBC Counselling, in 2015, 954 students were seen from September 1 to November 2. This year’s numbers, in that same two-month time span, jumped up by over 300 students, with 1,259 individuals seeking counselling. The service also sees a significant spike in demand during midterms and finals season."</p>
                <p class="description">The reception this article received (a high number of upvotes and responses) provided insight on the popularity and severity of the issue. I wanted to take all of this data and condense JangJudgement’s experience into a Journey Map, where I could organize and examine pain points and opportunities in greater detail.</p>

                <p class="description">I was finally in a good position to create some low fidelity wireframes. Paper prototyping is a fast way to get ideas out. This process is inherently messy — the boxes are uneven, the lines are wobbly, and the images are squares. The process would deter some, but I find that abstract looking screens are evaluated more on their function than their appearance. Paper prototyping prevents commitment to any user interface before the foundation is laid out, promoting better user experiences.</p>
                <img src="assets/paper-prototyping.jpeg" class="img-resizing-block">
                <p class="description">I went through variations of the prototype with 4 individuals, who provided a stream of consciousness as they navigated through different parts of the flow. After each individual, I made iterations to the prototype and presented them to the next. The biggest challenge was knowing when to stop and move onto wireframes. I had to ask myself what I was trying to achieve in this process and what should a successful prototype do or prove. At this stage, I wanted to ensure my user flow made sense not only in paper, but also in practice. Paper prototyping helped to flesh out issues related to that.</p>

                <p class="description">Although I wanted to go straight into high fidelity mock ups, I knew I wasn’t ready. I tested many aspects of my application, but nothing on usability. My paper prototypes captured the essence of the interface, but not the interface itself. I did some quick wireframing through Adobe XD and presented it to over 10 people. You can view the prototype <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/366403a6-48a9-42ef-4a22-2703b1ca0220-4055/" class="hovering-a">here.</a></p>

I wanted to use hand drawn illustrations to give a friendly feel to the app (I also love doing these illustrations!). I used colors from UBC’s official <a href="http://assets.brand.ubc.ca/downloads/ubc_visual_identity_guide.pdf" class="hovering-a">style guide</a> to create an association between this app and the school.</p>

                <p class="description">Finally! I made a prototype in Protopie that replicated the look and feel of the app. Using transitions helps indicate a change in state. I presented this to the same group in the paper protoyping phase and received more feedback on the visibility of certain features. For example, the bottom tab bar went through several iterations with different colors and styles to promote visibility without distracting users from their normal experience. As you view these different gifs, notice that they touch on the biggest pains that we’ve established from the survey above (appointment times and visibility of resources).</p>

                <p class="description">As determined by our survey, 58% of users were unaware of mental health apps for a variety of reasons. Taking information from the questionnaire directs users to resources that are the best fit for them, so that users can see the resources when they need them. This helps with visibility, and ensures that this information is no longer lost in a vast library of resources.</p>

Instead of just having access to UBC counsellors, users now have access to the network of counsellors in the Greater Vancouver area.</p>

                <p class="description">Mental health issues take a strain on our users; often, it’s difficult to attend classes or leave the house, which is why rescheduling appointments can be done in one centralized area. Less steps in this process promote accountability.</p>

                <p class="description">Now that the form is online, users don’t have to wait to drop in during counselling hours to complete it. This reduces the amount of time it takes to not only seek help, but receive access to it.</p>

                <p class="description">Overall, I’m pretty happy with the way this project turned out. Because this was such a large undertaking, I really wish I could revisit some areas related to the questionnaire and explore ways to improve that user experience.</p>
                <p class="description">Don’t worry about how things look when ideating. At this stage, it’s more important to capture your thoughts than visually design them. It prevents you from committing to ideas for their look instead of their function.</p>
                <p class="description">It’s important to empathize with users, but don’t forget to actually talk to them. And talk to MANY of them. Your users will have different priorities, and you need to explore the significance each issue holds.</p>
                <p class="emphasis-text">If you've made it this far, thanks for reading!</p>
